# Contact List on pure JavaScript

Created in October 2019

# About
I'm learning Javascript and it's time to do any project. I decided to create a contact list with add, delete and search. Before I started creating, I came across a BEM methodology. In my project, I used it to classes names, elements location in blocks, and set special classes for elements that are used in JS (like js-element-name). Also, in the process of creating, I decided to study the SCSS preprocessor and rewrite all the styles for it.  

I did this project in a week, but it fascinated me so much that I came in almost every day and fixed some bugs, rewrote and added methods. Of course, I faced some problems that could be solved only through kludges, but in the future I will pay more attention to such things. I understood my weaknesses and will continue to develop.

# Result
As a result, I got a lot of pleasure from creating this project. I studied new technologies, practiced writing JS-code, refactoring and code optimization. And now I finally have my own project.
